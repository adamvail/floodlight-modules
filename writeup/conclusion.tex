\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have created Floodlight-CD, which incorporates security policy enforcement into the Floodlight OpenFlow controller.
Floodlight-CD successfully performs conflict detection to address several security issues facing Floodlight today.
We secured Floodlight against two significant attacks.
The first being malicious applications attempting to subvert existing rules in a switch's flow table.
This was achieved through the use of alias-reduced rules combined with pairwise comparison of rule combinations on a single switch.
The second attack, controller based rule evasion, was prevented by forcing the controller to check outgoing packets against the switch's flow table.
Both of these attacks were mitigated while incuring a 15\% overhead over Floodlight as it stands today.
