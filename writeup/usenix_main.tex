% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
In most OpenFlow (OF) controller implementions, applications can insert flow rules into a switch that conflict with and subvert the intent of existing rules. 
A prominent example of this is dynamic tunneling, in which a malicious application inserts rules into an OF switch to route packets around a firewall. 

We created such a subversive application for the Floodlight controller to explore the inefficiencies in current conflict detection.
We then extended the Floodlight OF controller to incorporate security-policy enforcement to defend against such attacks. 
In particular, we adopt the alias-reduced rule conflict-detection approach introduced in FortNOX \cite{Porras:2012:SEK:2342441.2342466} to protect against rule subversion as well as an implemention to prevent a novel attack called controller-based rule evasion. 

Floodlight-CD successfully prevents both single-switch dynamic tunneling and controller based rule evasion, while incuring an approximately 15\% overhead over a baseline Floodlight configuration.
