The code is meant to fit into the Floodlight tree. The secure and alias classes are standalone.

The OFSwitchBase class is meant to replace the current OFSwitchBase class currently in net/floodlight/controller/core/OFSwitchBase.
The secure code is called by the write() function in OFSwitchBase.

The SecureFlowRemovedListner module is intended to be run as a normal application and thus must be included in configuration files.
